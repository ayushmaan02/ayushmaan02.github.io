                <h2>Mazda CX-30</h2>
                <p>
                    Slotting into the Mazda SUV lineup in the narrow space between the subcompact CX-3 and the compact CX-5 is the new—and curiously named—CX-30. Why isn't it called CX-4? We asked Mazda: It's kind of a long story. Regardless of what it is called, we like the way it looks. Mazda's designers gave it a more severely forward-canted rear window and chunkier black-plastic body cladding to help differentiate the 2020 Mazda CX-30 from its other crossover siblings. The CX-30 comes standard with impressive technology, both in terms of connectivity and driver-assistance features. Equipped with the same perky and responsive engine as the Mazda 3, the CX-30 oozes that enthusiast appeal for which Mazda is famous.
                    All CX-30s are equipped with a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine with 186 horsepower; a six-speed automatic is the only transmission available and although it chooses gears wisely based on driving conditions, it exhibits an occasional stumble when shifting.
                    Front-wheel-drive CX-30 models receive fuel-economy estimates of 25 mpg city, 33 mpg highway, and 28 mpg combined from the EPA; all-wheel drive drops the estimates to 24 city, 31 mpg, and 26 mpg. 
                    Last but not the least the starting price range of Mazda CX-30, is supposed to be $23,000.
